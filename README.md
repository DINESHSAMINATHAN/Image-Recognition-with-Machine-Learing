# Image-Recognition-with-Machine-Learing

## ABSTRACT


Image recognition is a field of computer vision that deals with the automated identification of objects, places, or people in digital images or videos. Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn without being explicitly programmed. When combined, image recognition and machine learning can be used to create powerful systems that can identify objects in images with a high degree of accuracy. There are many different machine learning algorithms that can be used for image recognition. Some of the most common algorithms include support vector machines, decision trees, and neural networks. Once the algorithm has been trained, it can be used to identify objects in new images. This can be done by feeding the new images into the algorithm and then predicting the class of each object. The accuracy of the predictions will depend on the quality of the training data and the complexity of the algorithm.

## CHAPTER-1 INTRODUCTION

Object Recognition is a technology that lies under the broader domain of Computer Vision. This technology is capable of identifying objects that exist in images and videos and tracking them. Object Recognition also known as Object Detection, has various applications like face recognition, vehicle recognition, pedestrian counting, self-driving vehicles, security systems, and a lot more.

### 1.1.	BACKGROUND:
Image recognition with machine learning is a rapidly growing field with a wide range of potential applications. As the technology continues to develop, we can expect to see even more innovative and exciting applications of image recognition in the years to come. There are many different machine learning algorithms that can be used for image recognition. Some of the most common algorithms include support vector machines, decision trees, and neural networks. The choice of algorithm will depend on the specific task at hand.

### 1.2.	PROBLEM STATEMENT:
This technology is also used in autonomous vehicles to detect obstacles and navigate roads. Object detection can be used to identify individuals objects in images. By combining image recognition and machine learning, computers are able to identify objects and other features in images with increasing accuracy. Additionally, the accuracy of the computerâ€™s predictions can vary depending on the quality of the images.
 
### 1.3.	OBJECTIVES:

Image recognition is a powerful tool that can be used to automate a wide range of tasks. However, it is important to note that image recognition is not perfect. Models can make mistakes, especially when the images are noisy or cluttered. It is important to use image recognition in conjunction with other methods, such as human verification, to ensure accuracy. Object detection is used to identify objects in images. It is used in a variety of applications, such as self-driving cars, robotics, and medical image analysis.

## CHAPTER-5 CONCLUSION

Autonomous vehicles will benefit the economy through fuel efficiency, the environment through reduced carbon emissions, society through more togetherness, and the legal system through a simpler system of liability. Object detection is a critical component of autonomous vehicles, as it enables the vehicle to perceive its environment and make informed decisions about how to navigate through it. With advances in machine learning, computer vision, and sensor technology, object detection algorithms have become more accurate and reliable, enabling autonomous vehicles to identify and track objects in real-time.
